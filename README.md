<h4>Learn to Code. Code by Doing.</h4>

This is a cool project that I worked on over the course of a month and a half to help me build my first webapp.
It's a bit confusing but I started learning to code by building this app that finds lessons that teach  you how to code.
I wanted to share this project so I decided to make it available for others to build their own coding tutorial sites.
It's a pretty basic app but for anyone looking to have their own coding tutorial webapp it's a great tool.
Once I learn how to convert and deploy my database to Heroku I'll include that info as well.

<b>Here's the current link to the example site:</b>

*I'm still currently working on deploying my app to Heroku for display*

<h4>Key Features</h4>

I included some cool features to make the webapp a little more advanced than just a display app.

<b>Key features are:</b>

• Database Search
• Speech to Text
• Multi word search
• Inline frame website preview
• Pop-up side navigation search results
• Customizable Link scraping

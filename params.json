Code to learn.</h4>\r\n\r\nThis is a cool project that I worked on over the course of a month and a half to help me build my first webapp.\r\nIt's a bit confusing but I started learning to code by building this app that finds lessons that teach  you how to code.\r\nI wanted to share this project so I decided to make it available for others to build their own coding tutorial sites.\r\nIt's a pretty basic app but for anyone looking to have their own coding tutorial webapp it's a great tool.\r\nOnce I learn how to convert and deploy my database to Heroku I'll include that info as well.\r\n\r\n<h4>Key Features</h4>\r\n\r\nI included some cool features to make the webapp a little more advanced than just a display app.\r\n\r\n<b>Key features are:</b>\r\n\r\n• Database Search\r\n• Speech to Text\r\n• Multi word search\r\n• Inline frame website preview\r\n• Pop-up side navigation search results\r\n• Customizable Link scraping\r\n\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
